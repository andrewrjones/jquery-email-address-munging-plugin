jQuery Email Address Munging Plugin
-----------------------------------

This is a simple plugin for jQuery that converts email addresses such as you [at] example [dot] com into clickable mailto links.

To use it, simply add the plugins JS file to the page and write your email address in your page, as follows:

    <span class="email">you [at] example [dot] com</span>

Then use the following JS to initialise it:

    jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
      $(".email").emailAddressMunging();
    });
